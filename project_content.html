      <h3>Background</h3>

      <h4>What is Polaris?</h4>
      <p>Shopify’s design system, Polaris, was launched in April 2017 to help the entire company create user experiences for merchants efficiently and consistently. Polaris is comprised of a Sketch UI kit, a component library, and a comprehensive online style guide. Both internal and external developers, designers, content strategists, and other stakeholders from various disciplines use Polaris on a daily basis to design and build Shopify products. As such, the Polaris style guide documents a wide range of topics, such as tone of voice, usage of colours, component rationales, and accessibility guidelines.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
      <p>The Polaris style guide has a large amount of content, but lacked a global search function, which slowed users down when looking for information. Having a search function is a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-and-you-may-find/" target="_blank">best practice</a> for content-heavy sites such as the Polaris style guide. As a reference guide, the Polaris style guide needs to have high <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/navigation-ia-tests/" target="_blank">"findability"</a> as users need to quickly and successfully find the content they need.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Approach</h4>
      <p>After gaining context for Polaris and the online style guide through informal interviews of my fellow Shopifolk, I created and ran a usability study in the form of a benchmark study. This was to formally identify pain points and have quantitative data to compare before and after search is implemented, including future iterations of search. This was also helpful for another design project for the style guide I was working on. Then, I had to tackle iterations in three areas: the visual/interaction design, the information architecture, and the metadata search strategy.</p>

      <br>
      
      <h3>User Research</h3>
      
      <p>When I joined the UX system team, there had yet to be any formal user research done on Polaris, so I created and ran a study to see how users currently interact with the style guide website and what their mental model of the website is. This is to ensure the search feature will match pre-existing mental models (an important principle for usability) and enhance current workflows. [7] I had three main research goals:
• (Utility of the feature) How well does style guide work without global search? How
does the current component search work? How well will global search work once
it’s implemented?
• (Usability/Findability) How easy and quick is it to find content you’re looking for
within the style guide?
• (Information Architecture/ Discoverability) How intuitive are the groupings and
navigation structure of the content and components? Do people use the existing
components search bar?

      <h5 class="projectHeader">Design Project | May 2016 - July 2016</h5>
      <br>

      <h4>Introduction</h4><br>
      
      <p id="description"><b>Context of Project:</b> Design project in response to design prompt based loosely on <a href="http://safety.xprize.org/about/guidelines" target="_blank">X-Prize prompt.</a> Done with design sprint method outlined in <a href="http://www.thesprintbook.com/" target="_blank">Sprint by Jake Knapp.</a>
      <br><br><b>Role: </b>Team member in group of 7, designed flows and visuals for product app.<br>
        <br><b>Vision:</b> We want to be able to make a product that provides women confidence that she will be able to get help during and after an assault.<br><br>

<b>Issue Statement:</b> 25% of North American women are assaulted during their lifetime. Only 6% are reported to the police due to insufficient evidence against assaulter and social repercussion of assault. Women need tools to get help during an assault and to collect evidence to pursue legal action.<br><br>

<b>Method:</b> We will use user interviews and usability testing to evaluate the effectiveness of our solution.<br></p><br>

      <h4>Problem Space</h4>
      <p>The goal of this sprint is to ensure that if a woman becomes the target of an assault, she will have the necessary tools to reach out for help. This includes sending for aid during an attack, or if that is not possible, giving her the confidence and ability to successfully pursue legal litigation.<br>
While devices such as rape whistles and hidden cameras exist, there are a plethora of apps that are available to help against sexual assault. However, an attacker would likely seize, destroy, and harm the victim if they thought they were being recorded. Because most sexual assault cases are crimes of opportunity, devices such as rape whistles might not be as effective because a user might not want to carry that with them at all times, and if the user has time to access their phone, they would likely call the police or a friend instead of using an anti-assault device or app. Lastly, the devices such as hidden cameras are ineffective because a majority of victims cannot afford the price.

      <h3 class="projectHeader">Boltmade Card Sorting Workshop</h3>


      <h5 class="projectHeader">Boltmade | January 2016 - April 2016</h5>
      <br>
      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>I designed and led a public workshop on card sorting as a UX research tool for Boltmade as a side project during my internship there. You can read the blogpost I wrote on card sorting and the workshop <a class="paragraph_link" href="http://www.boltmade.com/blog/instructional/card-sorting-workshop" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>

      <h4>Who is Boltmade?</h4>
      <p>Boltmade is a <a class="paragraph_link" href="http://wayswework.io/spotlights/a-day-with-boltmade" target="_blank">highly-collaborative</a> design and development consulting agency that works with various clients to design and build out software, typically for mobile and web platforms. A recent client project involved the design and development of a new feature for an app that has over 200 million users worldwide.</p><br>
      
      <h4>Project Background</h4>
      <p>Boltmade hosts free monthly workshops for the local community on various design and development topics called "Boltmade Sessions," in order to give back knowledge to the community and help build community and expertise in the Kitchener-Waterloo area. When I started my internship with Boltmade, it had been a while since a Boltmade Session had been held. And so, I happily volunteered to do a workshop on card sorting as a side project. I really liked how effective the tool was in UX research, and I had recently used it as part of the design process for a client project I was working on at Boltmade (which I cannot include on this website yet since it has not been released).</p><br>
      
      <h4>Design Process</h4>
      <p>The workshop was targeting people from the Kitchener-Waterloo region with all levels of expertise, including ones that have little to no user experience knowledge or expertise, much less knowledge in card sorting. As such, I wanted to create an experience that let them know what card sorting was and convince them that it's a tool that they should definitely use when a situation calls for it.<br>
      <br>I first structured the workshop mainly centered around a card sorting activity that the participants would do. I knew for sure that I wanted for the activity to be done in small groups, as reccommended by Donna Spencer in her book <a class="paragraph_link"  href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/card-sorting/" target="_blank">Card Sorting: Designing Usable Categories</a>. It would help people in the workshop who hadn't done it before feel comfortable doing it together with others, and it would also spark rich discussion during the sort, which is valuable to the actual UX research. wasn't sure at first what exactly the participants should sort.<br>
        <br>My main goal was to show the power of card sorting, and part of that was showing how between multiple sorts, there can be both strong agreements and disagreements on where a card is grouped. As such, I needed to make cards with content that had some agreement, but also a lot of freedom for people to interpret it differently. I also wanted to use a domain that was familiar so people wouldn't be thrown off by technical terms or jargon. Originally, I wanted to do foods, with the context being sorting them for a supermarket. However, supermarkets already have extremely well-defined groupings that everyone is familiar with, so we wouldn't get interesting results. I ended up with doing a museum exhibit sort - the cards would each have the name of an exhibit, and participants would sort them into groups that just made sense. I liked this because it gave a wide range of cards I could use, but also had a context of something that people were somewhat familiar with, but not too much that all the sorts would be agreeable.</p><br>
      
      <h4>Test Run</h4>
      <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Boltmade_Monday_Sort.jpg">
      <p class="caption">Some Boltmade employees in the middle of a card sort.</p><br>
      <p>I ran the initial iteration of my card sort workshop as Boltmade's weekly lunch-and-learn, as captured by some the photos above. I started out with a brief spiel about card sorting, and dove right into the activity. I had people in groups of 3-4 sort about 40 cards with museum exhibit names on them. People seemed to really enjoy going through all the cards and sorting them as they please, and also discussing (sometimes very passionately!) about how to sort some of the cards. At the end of the activity, I wanted to make them observe the differences and similarities between the sorts, and also try to "test" out the sorts. And so, I had some people from each group go around to each of the other sorts, and attempt to "guess" where some of the cards would be based on the category names given.</p><br>
      
      <h4>Changes</h4>
      <p>I received some great feedback from the Boltmade lunch-and-learn. I also thought more about the structure of the workshop and give it more value - I added a second activity that explored a different type of sort - one that was done individually, and using an online tool to explore the advantages and use case for that kind of sort. For that sort, I wanted to make sure I used an interesting topic to engage the workshop participants. I also wanted to use an existing site with content to let paritcipants see the similarities and differences between the actual website structure and the result of their sorts. As such, I chose a government website, but one about Banff National Park, so participants would still be engaged with a somewhat interesting topic. I also added in the component of analysis of the card sort results and how the paritcipants can use it as information to create the actual navigation structure of a product.</p><br>

      <p class="caption">Boltmade Session participants going around and observing the different sorts that everyone made.</p><br>
      <p>We had about 15 participants show up to the workshop, and everyone had a great time. We also got some <a class="paragraph_link"  href="http://www.meetup.com/boltmade-sessions/events/229760347/" target="_blank">really positive feedback</a> from our participants. More details can be found in the full-write up I wrote on the <a class="paragraph_link"  href="http://www.boltmade.com/blog/instructional/card-sorting-workshop" target="_blank">Boltmade blog</a>.</p><br>

      <h1>Online PlayStation&reg; Store</h1>
      <div id="highlight"></div>
      <h5>As one of three UX designers on my team, I was responsible for evaluating and improving the user experience of the PlayStation web store.<br><br><b>Role:</b> Product designer<br><b>Team:</b> Mentor, fellow design intern<br><b>Time:</b> ~1 month</h5>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>Sony Network Entertainment International (SNEI) develops the online network infrastructure to provide top-quality entertainment around the globe through games, videos, music, and other services. </p><br>


      <h4>What is the PlayStation Store?</h4>

      <p>The PlayStation web store is a digital media store that offer PlayStation console owners a variety of downloadable content for purchase or for free, such as full console games, add-ons, movies, and TV shows. It exists as an app directly on the PlayStation console, as well as an online webstore and a mobile web app version embedded within the PlayStation&reg;App, which has over 100 million downloads on Android. Although most users purchase and download content through the console store, usage of the web version is increasing and has unique use cases, as discovered through user research.</p>
      <br>

      <h4>Design Problem</h4>
      <p>My work involved the online version of the PlayStation store, which includes the mobile web app version since the online version is not responsive, and displays the separate mobile web app version on small screen sizes. The store has all the basic, primary user functions of an e-commerce website: the ability to browse, search, and purchase products.
        <br>
        <br>The current state of the store has a lot of room for improvement. My fellow intern Wynn and I performed an heuristic evaluation of the site and collectively found around 200 issues relating to visual layout, UI, and UX. One set of guidelines we used was Contrast, Repetititon, Alignment, and Proximity (ie. "C.R.A.P."), coined by visual designer Robin Williams. Although it was originally intended to be used for visual design, these principles can be applied to evaluating user experience as well - for example, repetition refers to having things that look the same should perform the same function, which matches Nielsen's usability principle of having "consistency and standards." As seen below, both buttons perform the same action of bringing users to a new page, but one has an extra arrow that might confuse users as to if it performs a different function than a button that only has one arrow.</p>
      <br>

        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>While top priority issues were being fixed for the short-term, we were tasked with the project of completely revamping the design and exploring new design directions that the PlayStation store can take.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>User Research</h4>
      <p>I first started off the process by creating personas to see how we could empathize with the users and their current frustrations with the PlayStation store, both the console and online version. This was especially important as I was not a regular user of any PlayStation products. Although I own some older generation consoles, I had never used the conssole store or the web store since its launch in 2011.
        <br>
        <br>Although I was unable to recruit participants for interviews as primary research due to time and budget constraints, I was able to do secondary research by going through many forum sites, both official PlayStation ones and non-official gaming sites. I captured quotes that had to do with how PlayStation users were interacting with the PlayStation store, especially the web version. I looked for both overall goals and context for using the website version, and particularly any points of frustration with the website. Once I collected around 50 quotes or so, I was able to see some patterns and was able to group the quotes into what would become the foundations for the different persons.
        <br>
        <br>I also explored some general research on e-commerce usage - I came across a really neat site that grouped e-commerce users into different types of shoppers, all having relatively dinstinct and unique use cases and motivations when using an online store. I saw some potential overlap between these types of shoppers and the quotes I collected, and incorporated them into the personas. Based on the personas and internal PlayStation user research material, I created 6 distinct personas, some of which can be seen below:</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Competitor Analysis + Mobile Inspiration</h4>
        <p>I then looked into how other e-commerce sites are being designed, especially how they do their mobile store. An e-commerce store has a lot of functions, so to elegantly present it on small screen is no easy feat. I researched various websites that were both e-commerce and not e-commerce. One main thing I began to notice is that many e-commerce sites were clearly designed mobile-first. Even on the desktop version, it had elements that you usually only saw on mobile, such as a hamburger menu and interaction items/areas that took up a large percentage of the screen. I printed some of my favourite ones and labelled both interested and flawed UI interactions and UX points (particularly searching and check-out) flows, as seen in the following photos:</p>

        </div>


        <div class="col-md-6">

          <h4>Conceptualizing Design Goals</h4>
          <p>Based on the user research, competitive analysis, our mood board, our own design intuition, design heuristics, and our new PlayStation Store branding guidelines (which we also made but unfortunately am not allowed to share), Wynn and I came up with about 30 keywords that a user would use to describe the overall user experience of the new PlayStation store. We then wanted to see what more people thought about our goals to identify the ones that are the most important. Again, since we didn't have access to regular users via recruiting, we did a card sorting exercise with various employees at SNEI Waterloo. Although this is less than ideal as it doesn't truely represent our user base and has a bias towards people that are very technical and likely to find it easy to use an e-commerce store, it was also representative of some users since many, if not all, were regular users of the PlayStation and PlayStation store.
            <br>
            <br>In the exercise, the employees were asked to sort the words into three tiers of importance, with the 1st tier being the most important. Some keywords were also added in by the employees during the exercise. In the following table, the user experience keywords are shown in order of their overall score.</p><br>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="img/UXTable.png">
          <p class="caption">Table of calculated results from UX goals sorting exercise.</p>

          <p id="description">
            <br> The overall score was calculated by giving three points every time it was sorted into 1st tier, two points every time it was sorted into 2nd tier, and one point every time it was sorted into 3rd tier, then dividing up that total by the number of employees that participated (nine, in this case.) In other words, if a key word was sorted into 1st tier by all of the participants, its overall score would be 3.
            <br>
            <br> As seen, some obvious user experience key words are at the top. An e-commerce store most certainly should be easy to use and organized, and should perform fast to allow for the user to get the product they want as quickly as possible. Other, less technical terms also came up, which the design team felt was important to keep in mind, since users also want to feel certain ways about the overall store based on its aesthetics and user experience choices, such as being seamless and engaging. These also fit in with the PlayStation brand, as many modern video games are becoming more and more engaging, realistic, and seamless. Other design requirements are that the mobile website should include familiar mobile gesture like scrolling down, offer menus for specific navigations, offer an option use the full site, as well as keeping high-level, important functions visible at the top.
            <br>
            <br> To remind ourselves of the keywords that we came up with throughout the design process, Wynn created a lovely wordle with the most important keywords having the most prominence.</p>

          <br>
          <br>

          <h4>Mobile Search Design</h4>
          <p>After all the initial research done, I was tasked with specifically exploring mobile search design. I started out with sketches of ideas. The particular challenge in this case was how to display the results. The PlayStation Store has a variety of media content, mainly sorted in 3 types: Video Games, TV, or Movies. This presented unique requirements and constraints, as these sections are very distinct, so searches for these products was also likely to be distinct.
            <br>
            <br>I first sketched out various wireframes for the pre-search screen, when the user first clicks the "search" function, or clicks the search field. I wanted to give them their history as many users serach for products, but don't end up buying it as they want to do more research on the game, and then come back to it. Also, I wanted to give users the ability to see what other people were searching and what was popular, as many users also wanted to see that. Based on user research, many users searching on the store are looking to get to an exact product in the fastest time possible. As such, I also created a "mid-search" screen that auto-searched in the middle of the user typing out their query. Sorted based on relevancy, this provides a fast way to get to potentially what they are looking for. The solutions I liked the most and created a wireframe for can be seen below:</p>

          <br>
          <p>Once the user clicked the search or enter button on their keyboard, they would be taken to a more detailed results screen to browse, filter, and sort for the products they want. One unique requirement for this is that the search results have to show if the game has a special PS+ Membership price, on sale, or has some other unique promotion, all denoted with a small badge. In the final search result screen, I knew that I wanted to automatically presented the results sorted by each of the three content types offered by the PlayStation store (i.e. Games, Movies, TV Shows). This is because the categories are very distinct, so if users are looking for a TV show, their search result will definitely not be part of video games. With these requirements in mind, many alternatives were wireframed. The top two that were  considered are seen below:</p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-center">Alternative #1</p>

          <img class="img-responsive img-project-sm center-block" src="img/PS_SearchResult_1.png">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6 center">
              <p class="caption">Results page with tabs for each content type and a focus on visuals for each result item.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <br>

          <p>In alternative #1, the search results split into four tabs, With this interaction, if they search for a term like "Batman" which has products in all 4 categories, they can easily switch to the type of product they're looking for. Filters and sorting options are under each tab because they change depending on the type of content. The layout also displays only 4 products at a time, since each product has a relatively large image associated with it. This is to make the experience very immersive and engaging by providing large visuals of the media cover art, similar to how they would see it in a retail store.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <br>
            <p class="text-center">Alternative #2</p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img class="img-responsive img-project-sm center-block" src="img/PS_SearchResult_3.png">
              <p class="caption">Landing page for results. Top results (relevancy) per media type are all displayed at once.</p>
              <br>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img class="img-responsive img-project-sm center-block" src="img/PS_SearchResult_2.png">
              <p class="caption">Results page within a specific category. Filtering and sorting options would be seen here.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>In alternative #2, all three content categories are displayed at once, and the top three most relevant results per category are displayed in a list view. No thumbnails are displayed with the results so there is ample room to have the product title on one line and save vertical space in order to display as many results as possible. Clicking "see all" for any particular category will take users to a page that would display results with a small image and some product details in a list view to provide more visuals within a category. Breadcrumbs at the top keep the user reminded of where they are and allow for easy way to go back and see all.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Analysis of Alternatives</h4>
          <p>Alternative #1 is more engaging because it uses a grid view with larger images that also invoke the look of a physical video game or DVD case, but it is less organized since there is less room for information about the product. A list view would be easier to sort and compare as you can see more products at once, which is seen in alernative #2. This is important since a main purpose of the search function is to allow users to compare between options and find content easily based on their preferences. A main feature of alternative #1 that's really great is sorting the results into different tabs, since it makes it easier to go between the different categories of results (minimizing information access cost), and each tab has an icon in addition to text to emphasize the type of content each tab contains. Another plus for alternative one is that it displays an "all" results initially. Since users use the PlayStation store primarily for games, displaying the most relevant movies and TV shows upfront, as alternative #2 does, doesn't make efficient use of space.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Reccommendations</h4>
          <p>From the comparison of the three search results alternatives, alternative #1 seems to be the best choice for potential implementation to improve overall user experience. However, both alternatives have elements in their design that help increase the overall usability. For example, alternative #2 has a list view that would allow for easier comparison of basic information between different products in the search results than the grid view in alternative #1. As such, a final design should incorporate both elements by offering a choice to the user for the view of the search results. This way, users can either have a more immersive, visual experience of browsing the search results with a grid view, or have a quicker overview of more products at once with a list view.
            <br>
            <br> Usability testing should be done on the new design. Realistic scenarios and search tasks should be created and tested on to see how well users are able to complete them, and based on the results, the design should be iterated upon.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Retrospective</h4>
          <p>During initial analysis of the store, only a couple of design heuristics of the many that exist were used evaluate the usability of the store. A more in-depth analysis could have involved other usability heuristics. The UX goals card sorting exercise could have been done with more users, such as randomly recruited PSN members, in order to hear directly from the users and have a great variety in opinion. This is crucial in user experience design, as different users may have varying opinions on the usability of a product. For the mobile search design, I would've wanted to create even more iterations and variations. Also, because only basic wireframes were made and analyzed, some usability issues might have been overseen before deciding on a solution to move forward with for user testing. Higher fidelity prototypes can be made for more thorough and accurate user testing, although it is unneccessary for initial rounds of testing.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
            <h4>Remarks</h4><p>I would like to thank Jesse Wong for being a great mentor and supervisor, and Wynn Yau for being a wonderful fellow design co-op student to work with.</p>

      <p class="caption">First iteration of the ZOOM Day Challenge schedule I created</p><br>
      <p id="description">
        <br> Towards the end of my four months at the Manulife Research, Exploration, and Development (RED) Lab, our team helped run the
        <a href="http://www.bus-edpartnership.org/ZOOM-Career-Days.htm">ZOOM Day
            Challenge</a> - a program designed for local high school students to experience first-hand real-life work. We guided three high school students through a rapid prototyping challenge of making an app that would improve the banking experience. At the beginning, I wasn’t sure where they take our challenge, but in the end I was impressed. After going through a brainstorming exercise, many design iterations and customer interviews, they presented an interactive prototype to encourage saving. They had fun and came out in the end a little more knowledge about iterative mobile app design.
        <br>
        <br> Upon reflection, their experience over the course of a day was almost like what I went through the four months of my co-op. Not knowing a lot at the beginning, but eager to learn, and coming out with a lot more knowledge and experience.
        <br>
        <br> Overall, my time at the RED Lab was amazing. I got to be in an environment of fun, knowledgable, generally awesome techie people who could really appreciate a good start-up-related joke. (“That’s disruptive!”) I worked on projects focused mostly on user interaction innovation on web and iOS platforms. And even though before this work term I’ve never even owned a Mac before, it was a really cool opportunity to be able to learn Swift and Objective-C. Because of it, I was able to used those skills learned and actually
        <a href="http://hackthenorth.devpost.com/submissions/26989-judio">won the
            best iOS app prize</a> at my school’s hackathon! Our team also won the co-op innovation challenge for our facial-recognition idea for Manulife security, which was a fun side project.
        <br>
        <br> I’ve learned a lot of technical skills this term, but perhaps the most important thing I will be taking away is the spirit of innovation and prototyping. It’s the combination of collaborative and individual work that drives this spirit, and I look forward to implementing this where needed wherever I go in the future.
        <br>

      <h5 class="projectHeader">Side Project | December 2014 </h5>
      <br>
      <h4>What is FarmTable?</h4>
      <p>FarmTable is an online platform that allows farmers to sell and deliver produce directly to restaurants. It was a start-up run by two UW graduates.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Context of Work</h4>
      <p id="description">
        Through a referral, I was asked by the founder of FarmTable to do a quick visual mockup of how the landing page could possibly look. Under limited time constraints, I created a simple layout concept with general components.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Design Process</h4>
      <p id="description">At the time of the engagement, the founder already had some potential customers signed on for the MVP. I first started out by asking about the market research the founder had already done in Alberta, and what the farmers and restaurant's needs and frustrations were. In summary, the website needed to look professional, polished, and give them the information they want. The farmers are also not advanced technical users, so I wanted to make sure that it was clear what the main function of FarmTable was from the get-go. This led to the idea of visually showing that FarmTable was the bridge between farmers and restaurants, which was included early on in the design process.
        <br>
        <br> After some sketches and basic wireframes were drawn out, a quick draft was made in Sketch. In the design, I tried to follow Norman/Nielsen design principles to help the user match the website to their mental model of an e-commerce site - I showed examples of produce items that farmers were selling and were available to restaurants to order. This also serves as another entry point for onboarding, as users who would click the clear call-to-action of "Add to Cart" would be taken to a modal or new page to sign-in or register. Further down the page, I created an area to easily sign-up, with visual icons for different types of farms (something I learned about the farming users from interviewing the founder). Overall, I tried to make the design more visual, have minimal text, and straight-forward sign-up to communicate the purpose of FarmTable.

      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Retrospective</h4>
      <p>If I could go back to improve this project, I would have created many more variations to explore and user test to see if people could figure out what FarmTable does intuitively and quickly. I would try to map out some of the user flows for onboarding more, and create specificationss for exactly what each interaction item would lead to - this would also lead to the need of creating higher fidelity prototypes, since new interactions are probably needed (e.g. selecting the number of carrots on the example carrot item). I would also like to have designed more screens, such as how the sign-up would have looked like for the restaurant managers. I would also fix the many visual unpleasantries - for example, the colour of "farmers" and the background image behind it were simply placeholders, as were most of the images and text in the mock-up.</p>

      <h4>What is Judio?</h4>
      <p id="description">
        Judio is a social Music-Making App. Users can record their instrument or singing, then send it to their friends. They can then record and layer their own singing/instrument on top of it, and send it out again, etc. to create multi-track music. This makes long-distance music-making possible.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Where did the idea for Judio come from?</h4>
        <p>I conceived the idea as a result of a personal frustration - a high school friend and I loved to sing together, but we ended up going to different universities. We tried to create multi-track recordings together through various methods: by sending files back and forth through Audacity, by singing through Skype, etc. Nothing worked well for us. Thus, the idea for Judio was born.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>How was Judio made?</h4>
        <p>The first iteration was developed as Android app at MHacks Hackathon January 2013. I worked on it as a developer, focusing on Android AudioStream libraries and functions to multi-layer tracks. The project was further developed while I at the <a href="http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/">Velocity Residence</a> in Summer 2014. I lived with 70 other selected students who were passionate about entreprenuership. Each week, we were given talks by the start-up experienced to help further our ideas. Judio ended up being a finalist for $1k <a href="http://velocityfundfinals.com/">Velocity Fund Final</a> pitch competition.</p>

        <br>
        <p>In September 2014, the idea was brought to Hack the North, UW's inaugural hackathon, and Canada's biggest. As part of a team of three, I coded the UI in iOS using Swift, and coded the multi-track layering and playback using both Swift and Objective C. Our project ended up being the <a href="http://hackthenorth.devpost.com/submissions/26989-judio">winner of

      <h3 class="projectHeader">Canadian A Cappella Conference (CanACC) 2015</h3>
      <h5 class="projectHeader">Personal Project | February 2015 - October 2015 <br> Winner of Best New Initiative - Fall 2015 from FEDS</h5>
      <br>
      <h4>What is CanACC?</h4>
      <p id="description">
        The 1st-ever Canadian A Cappella Conference was a one-day event held at the University of Waterloo that brought together over 100 singers from 4 universities/colleges across 9 distinct a cappella groups. The event consisted of round-tables, workshops, and a showcase concert that brought collegiate a cappella from schools outside UW to campus for the first time.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Where did the idea come from?</h4>
        <p>The idea for the conferenced was conceived on a bus ride back from the 2015 ICCA competition. We were able to meet a lot of groups there and connect with like-minded people who were all passionate about the same thing - a cappella. Unfortunately, the ICCA competition is primarily American, and we knew that there were many Canadian groups that UW have not been able to connect with much. Canadian a cappella at colleges/universities is also very behind compared to the States in terms of how well developed and prominent it is. Although the a cappella scene with over 100 singers and 5-7 groups at Waterloo is a very strong community, there wasn't much contact with groups outside our school. As such, we wanted to create an event that brought together different Canadian a cappella groups in a non-competitive setting to learn and share beautiful music together and build a strong Canadian a cappella community.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Design Process</h4>
        <p>Aside from being co-chair of the conference which involed organizing workshop leaders and attendees, planning conference programming, and designing attendee experience, I also worked on a submission for the logo. The main themes I wanted to convey in the logo were music and Canada. The most obvious representation for Canada is the maple leaf, which is instantly recognizable and also has a strong colour associated with it. Because of that, then it will make sure the logo isn't perceived as bias towards any of the group attending, as many of the groups also have strong colour associations. Unfortunately, there isn't a wide range of visual representations for music or a cappella without the logo becoming too complicated or busy. I tried out a couple sketches, playing with music notes as well as audio waveforms.</p>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/CanACC_Sketches.jpg">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/CanACC_Sketch_2.jpg">
        <p class="caption">Initial sketches of logo design ideas.</p>

        <br>
        <p>One of my favourite ones I made was the one with the maple leaf breaking off into music notes - I thought it was really fitting because it shows that we can unite as Canadians through music, and we can build community through music, which was the main goal of our concert. Also, the large number of small music notes represent us as singers, since a cappella is all about individual voices joining together to be bigger than the sum of its parts. The downside of that logo was scaling: for small scale usage, the tiny details of the notes would be difficult to print and see. The logo was primarly being used on small promotional items and branding at the top of some documents, so unfortunately it would be unfeasible to continue with that concept.
          <br>
          <br>After bringing concepts to the CanACC organizing committee for feedback, the one that they liked the most was the top left one, with a centered maple leaf and audio waves going out on each side. I also liked this one because the way the audio lines crescendo toward the center places a central focus on the Canada leaf and the logo text, signifing how exciting and loud this event will be. Using Sketch, I created a couple variations. I played around with how the audio waves looked, and if I could maybe fit in the maple leaf directly into the audiowaves.</p>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/CanACC_Alternatives.png">
      <p class="caption">My initial proposed alternatives.</p>


        <p>These alternatives were again put forth for feedback. The first and fourth ones seemed to have the most amount of popularity, but people wanted to see the intensity of the soundwaves reduced in the first one to reduce clutter, maintain simplicity, and make sure it was feasible at a smaller size. After reducing the soundwave intensity, four alternatives from myself and another organizing member were put up for voting. The following logo won the most votes! </p>

        <p class="caption">Example of branding materials that used the logo. These buttons were for all conference attendees.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Retrospective</h4>
        <p>As usual, I didn't have a lot of time to put together the logo as we were under a time crunch to get materials printed with the logo. If I could go back, I definitely would've wanted to explore some of my initial sketches in a higher-fidelity format using Sketch, particularly the one with the maple leaf breaking into musical notes, and variations on that as well - for example, having the musical notes fall in from the top to create a sense of "falling into place" as opposed to "breaking away," and seeing if I could reduce detail to increase small-scale reproducability. For the actual logo that we chose, I also wish I could've picked a better font that was less generic. I also would've explored more how to make the logo more contained and united, as the elements in the logo feel somewhat spread out and not connected well with each other - the round, smooth waves clash somewhat with the pointiness of the maple leaf. I think the overall logo is not the most inspiring piece, but it truly gave our conference something visually to rally around and an elevated sense of professionalism.
      
          <br>CanACC was actually hosted for the 2nd time by another school, and I had the chance to implement some of the restrospective. I chose a better font that fit the wavy aesthetic of the audio wave lines, and added a gradient on both the leaf and the lines to make the red more cohesive with the black text.
      </p><br>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>The event was a really great success and everyone had a lot of fun meeting, learning, and enjoying beautiful music from each other. I also championed getting feedback from our conference participants, and got really great feedback on what we did well for the first ever conference and what we could do even better for next year - actually, Macappella from McMaster University, one of the participanting groups, was so inspired that they wanted to take on hosting the conference in 2016, and it was an absolute success yet again. It's really cool to see such a network and community building in Canada already!</p>
