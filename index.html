                        <br>
                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p id="description">Sony Network Entertainment International (SNEI) develops the online network infrastructure for Sony to provide top-quality entertainment around the globe through games, videos, music, and other services. I worked at the Waterloo division, led by Tony Jedlovsky, on the design team under my supervisor, Jesse Wong.
                            <br>
                        
                            <br>
The Waterloo division of SNEI is responsible for software engineering and design of various SNEI services such as the online PlayStation store, MediaGo, and the PS Video App.  As a user experience designer, I was mainly responsible for evaluating and improving the user experience of the PlayStation web store. 
I would like to thank Jesse Wong for being a great mentor and supervisor, as well as Wynn Yau for being a wonderful fellow design co-op student to work with.</p>
                        
                        <div class="col-sm-12"><img class=
                            "img-responsive img-thumbnail" src=

                            <br>

                        <h4><br>UX has Feelings, Too</h4>
                        <p id="description">The main requirement for the PlayStation store is that
                        it must have the basic functions of an e-commerce website: the ability to
                        browse, search, and purchase products. The store must also be responsive,
                        or be able to render itself for proper viewing and interaction on mobile
                        devices, which have significantly smaller screen space than a desktop
                        computer.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As part of a design overhaul project, the design team decided to ask various employees at the SNEI
                        Waterloo location on what they thought the overall user experience of the
                        PlayStation store should be using keywords that the design team came up
                        with while thinking about design heuristics as well as the overall
                        PlayStation brand. Some key words were also added in by the employees
                        during the exercise. In the exercise, the employees were asked to sort the
                        words into three tiers of importance, with the 1st tier being the most
                        important. In the following table, the top eight user experience keywords
                            are shown in order of their overall score.</p>

                            <img class=
                            "img-responsive img-thumbnail" src=
                            "img/UXTable.png">
                            
                        <br>
                        <p id="description"><br>
                        The overall score was calculated
                        by giving three points every time it was sorted into 1st tier, two points
                        every time it was sorted into 2nd tier, and one point every time it was
                        sorted into 3rd tier, then dividing up that total by the number of
                        employees that participated (nine, in this case.) In other words, if a key
                        word was sorted into 1st tier by all of the participants, its overall score
                        would be 3.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            As seen, some obvious user experience key words are at the top.
                        An e-commerce store most certainly should be easy to use and organized, and
                        should perform fast to allow for the user to get the product they want as
                        quickly as possible. Other, less technical terms also came up, which the
                        design team felt was important to keep in mind, since users also want to
                        feel certain ways about the overall store based on its aesthetics and user
                        experience choices, such as being seamless and engaging. These also fit in
                        with the PlayStation brand, as many modern video games are becoming more
                        and more engaging, realistic, and seamless. Other design requirements are
                        that the mobile website should include familiar mobile gesture like
                        scrolling down, offer menus for specific navigations, offer an option use
                        the full site, as well as keeping high-level, important function visible at
                        the top.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To remind ourselves of the keywords that we came up with throughout the design process, Wynn created a lovely wordle with the most important keywords having the most prominence.

                        <p id="description"><br>Towards the end of my four months
                        at the Manulife Research, Exploration, and Development
                        (RED) Lab, our team helped run the <a href=
                        "http://www.bus-edpartnership.org/ZOOM-Career-Days.htm">
                        ZOOM Day Challenge</a> - a program designed for local
                        high school students to experience first-hand real-life
                        work. We guided three high school students through a
                        rapid prototyping challenge of making an app that would
                        improve the banking experience. At the beginning, I
                        wasn’t sure where they take our challenge, but in the
                        end I was impressed. After going through a
                        brainstorming exercise, many design iterations and
                        customer interviews, they presented an interactive
                        prototype to encourage saving. They had fun and came
                        out in the end a little more knowledge about iterative
                        mobile app design.<br>
                        <br>
                        Upon reflection, their experience over the course of a
                        day was almost like what I went through the four months
                        of my co-op. Not knowing a lot at the beginning, but
                        eager to learn, and coming out with a lot more
                        knowledge and experience.<br>
                        <br>
                        Overall, my time at the RED Lab was amazing. I got to
                        be in an environment of fun, knowledgable, generally
                        awesome techie people who could really appreciate a
                        good start-up-related joke. (“That’s disruptive!”) I
                        worked on projects focused mostly on user interaction
                        innovation on web and iOS platforms. And even though
                        before this work term I’ve never even owned a Mac
                        before, it was a really cool opportunity to be able to
                        learn Swift and Objective-C. Because of it, I was able
                        to used those skills learned and actually <a href=
                        "http://hackthenorth.devpost.com/submissions/26989-judio">
                        won the best iOS app prize</a> at my school’s
                        hackathon! Our team also won the co-op innovation
                        challenge for our facial-recognition idea for Manulife
                        security, which was a fun side project.<br>
                        <br>
                        I’ve learned a lot of technical skills this term, but
                        perhaps the most important thing I will be taking away
                        is the spirit of innovation and prototyping. It’s the
                        combination of collaborative and individual work that
                        drives this spirit, and I look forward to implementing
                        this where needed wherever I go in the future.<br>
                        <br>
                        Below are snapshots of one project I worked on, which was a
                        re-invented online banking UI with dashboard-style
                        widgets to give user the feel and look of full control

                        <p>As Musical Director for ACE, University of Waterloo's largest a cappella group, I created an 8-part arrangement of Sing by My Chemical Romance. I wanted to create story with the arrangement, and started out with a creepy vibe that becomes more hopeful. I also sampled a section of Sing by The Carpenters, a song popularized by Sesame Street.</p>
