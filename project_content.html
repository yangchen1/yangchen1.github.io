      <h4>Introduction</h4>


      <p id="description">Sony Network Entertainment International (SNEI) develops the online network infrastructure to provide top-quality entertainment around the globe through games, videos, music, and other services. As a user experience designer, I was responsible for evaluating and improving the user experience of the PlayStation web store.</p>


      <div class="row">
      </div>


      <h4><br>
            What is the PlayStation Store?</h4>


      <p id="description">The main requirement for the PlayStation store is that it must have the basic functions of an e-commerce website: the ability to browse, search, and purchase products. The store must also be responsive, or be able to render itself for proper viewing and interaction on mobile devices, which have significantly smaller screen space than a desktop computer.
        <br>
        <br> As part of a design overhaul project, the design team decided to ask various employees at the SNEI Waterloo location on what they thought the overall user experience of the PlayStation store should be using keywords that the design team came up with while thinking about design heuristics as well as the overall PlayStation brand. Some key words were also added in by the employees during the exercise. In the exercise, the employees were asked to sort the words into three tiers of importance, with the 1st tier being the most important. In the following table, the user experience keywords are shown in order of their overall score.</p>
      <img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="img/UXTable.png">
      <br>


      <p id="description">
        <br> The overall score was calculated by giving three points every time it was sorted into 1st tier, two points every time it was sorted into 2nd tier, and one point every time it was sorted into 3rd tier, then dividing up that total by the number of employees that participated (nine, in this case.) In other words, if a key word was sorted into 1st tier by all of the participants, its overall score would be 3.
        <br>
        <br> As seen, some obvious user experience key words are at the top. An e-commerce store most certainly should be easy to use and organized, and should perform fast to allow for the user to get the product they want as quickly as possible. Other, less technical terms also came up, which the design team felt was important to keep in mind, since users also want to feel certain ways about the overall store based on its aesthetics and user experience choices, such as being seamless and engaging. These also fit in with the PlayStation brand, as many modern video games are becoming more and more engaging, realistic, and seamless. Other design requirements are that the mobile website should include familiar mobile gesture like scrolling down, offer menus for specific navigations, offer an option use the full site, as well as keeping high-level, important functions visible at the top.
        <br>
        <br> To remind ourselves of the keywords that we came up with throughout the design process, Wynn created a lovely wordle with the most important keywords having the most prominence.</p>

      <p id="description">
        <br> Towards the end of my four months at the Manulife Research, Exploration, and Development (RED) Lab, our team helped run the
        <a href="http://www.bus-edpartnership.org/ZOOM-Career-Days.htm">ZOOM Day
            Challenge</a> - a program designed for local high school students to experience first-hand real-life work. We guided three high school students through a rapid prototyping challenge of making an app that would improve the banking experience. At the beginning, I wasn’t sure where they take our challenge, but in the end I was impressed. After going through a brainstorming exercise, many design iterations and customer interviews, they presented an interactive prototype to encourage saving. They had fun and came out in the end a little more knowledge about iterative mobile app design.
        <br>
        <br> Upon reflection, their experience over the course of a day was almost like what I went through the four months of my co-op. Not knowing a lot at the beginning, but eager to learn, and coming out with a lot more knowledge and experience.
        <br>
        <br> Overall, my time at the RED Lab was amazing. I got to be in an environment of fun, knowledgable, generally awesome techie people who could really appreciate a good start-up-related joke. (“That’s disruptive!”) I worked on projects focused mostly on user interaction innovation on web and iOS platforms. And even though before this work term I’ve never even owned a Mac before, it was a really cool opportunity to be able to learn Swift and Objective-C. Because of it, I was able to used those skills learned and actually
        <a href="http://hackthenorth.devpost.com/submissions/26989-judio">won the
            best iOS app prize</a> at my school’s hackathon! Our team also won the co-op innovation challenge for our facial-recognition idea for Manulife security, which was a fun side project.
        <br>
        <br> I’ve learned a lot of technical skills this term, but perhaps the most important thing I will be taking away is the spirit of innovation and prototyping. It’s the combination of collaborative and individual work that drives this spirit, and I look forward to implementing this where needed wherever I go in the future.

      <h5 class="projectHeader">Side Project | December 2014 </h5>
      <br>
      <h4>What is FarmTable?</h4>
      <p>FarmTable is an online platform that allows farmers to sell and deliver produce directly to restaurants. It was a start-up run by two UW graduates.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Context of Work</h4>
        <p id="description">
          Through a referral, I was asked by the founder of FarmTable to do a quick visual mockup of how the landing page could possibly look. Under limited time constraints, I created a simple layout concept with general components.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Design Process</h4>
        <p id="description">At the time of the engagement, the founder already had some potential customers signed on for the MVP. I first started out by asking about the market research the founder had already done in Alberta, and what the farmers and restaurant's needs and frustrations were. In summary, the website needed to look professional, polished, and give them the information they want. The farmers are also not advanced technical users, so I wanted to make sure that it was clear what the main function of FarmTable was from the get-go. This led to the idea of visually showing that FarmTable was the bridge between farmers and restaurants, which was included early on in the design process.
          <br>
          <br> After some sketches and basic wireframes were drawn out, a quick draft was made in Sketch. In the design, I tried to follow Norman/Nielsen design principles to help the user match the website to their mental model of an e-commerce site - I showed examples of produce items that farmers were selling and were available to restaurants to order. This also serves as another entry point for onboarding, as users who would click the clear call-to-action of "Add to Cart" would be taken to a modal or new page to sign-in or register. Further down the page, I created an area to easily sign-up, with visual icons for different types of farms (something I learned about the farming users from interviewing the founder). Overall, I tried to make the design more visual, have minimal text, and straight-forward sign-up to communicate the purpose of FarmTable.

        <br>
        <h4>Retrospective</h4>
        <p>If I could go back to improve this project, I would try to map out some of the user flows more and create specificationss for exactly what each interaction item would lead to - this would also lead to the need of creating higher fidelity prototypes, since new interactions are probably needed (e.g. selecting the number of carrots on the example carrot item). I would also like to have designed more screens, such as how the sign-up would have looked like for the restaurant managers. I would also fix the visual unpleasantries - for example, the colour of "farmers" and the background image behind it were simply placeholders, as most of the images and text in the mock-up were.</p>

      <h4>What is Judio?</h4>
      <p id="description">
        Judio is a social Music-Making App. Users can record their instrument or singing, then send it to their friends. They can then record and layer their own singing/instrument on top of it, and send it out again, etc. to create multi-track music. This makes long-distance music-making possible.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Where did the idea for Judio come from?</h4>
        <p>I conceived the idea as a result of a personal frustration - a high school friend and I loved to sing together, but we ended up going to different universities. We tried to create multi-track recordings together through various methods: by sending files back and forth through Audacity, by singing through Skype, etc. Nothing worked well for us. Thus, the idea for Judio was born.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>How was Judio made?</h4>
        <p>The first iteration was developed as Android app at MHacks Hackathon January 2013. I worked on it as a developer, focusing on Android AudioStream libraries and functions to multi-layer tracks. The project was further developed while I at the <a href="http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/">Velocity Residence</a> in Summer 2014. I lived with 70 other selected students who were passionate about entreprenuership. Each week, we were given talks by the start-up experienced to help further our ideas. Judio ended up being a finalist for $1k <a href="http://velocityfundfinals.com/">Velocity Fund Final</a> pitch competition.</p>

        <p>In September 2014, the idea was brought to Hack the North, UW's inaugural hackathon, and Canada's biggest. As part of a team of three, I coded the UI in iOS using Swift, and coded the multi-track layering and playback using both Swift and Objective C. Our project ended up being the <a href="http://hackthenorth.devpost.com/submissions/26989-judio">winner of
            the Best iOS App prize</a> sponsored by Apple. The project is currently on hold.

      <h5 class="projectHeader">Personal Project | February 2015 - October 2015 <br> Winner of Best New Initiative - Fall 2015 from FEDS</h5>
      <br>
      <h4>What is CanACC?</h4>
      <p id="description">
        The 1st-ever Canadian A Cappella Conference was a one-day event held at the University of Waterloo that brought together over 100 singers from 4 universities/colleges across 9 distinct a cappella groups. The event consisted of round-tables, workshops, and a showcase concert that brought collegiate a cappella from schools outside UW to campus for the first time.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Where did the idea come from?</h4>
        <p>The idea for the conferenced was conceived on a bus ride back from the 2015 ICCA competition. We were able to meet a lot of groups there and connect with like-minded people who were all passionate about the same thing - a cappella. Unfortunately, the ICCA competition is primarily American, and we knew that there were many Canadian groups that UW have not been able to connect with much. Canadian a cappella at colleges/universities is also very behind compared to the States in terms of how well developed and prominent it is. Although the a cappella scene with over 100 singers and 5-7 groups at Waterloo is a very strong community, there wasn't much contact with groups outside our school. As such, we wanted to create an event that brought together different Canadian a cappella groups in a non-competitive setting to learn and share beautiful music together and build a strong Canadian a cappella community.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Design Process</h4>
        <p>Aside from being co-chair of the conference which involed organizing workshop leaders and attendees, planning conference programming, and designing attendee experience, I also worked on a submission for the logo. The main themes I wanted to convey in the logo were music and Canada. The most obvious representation for Canada is the maple leaf, which is instantly recognizable and also has a strong colour associated with it. Because of that, then it will make sure the logo isn't perceived as bias towards any of the group attending, as many of the groups also have strong colour associations. Unfortunately, there isn't a wide range of visual representations for music or a cappella without the logo becoming too complicated or busy. I tried out a couple sketches, playing with music notes as well as audio waveforms.</p>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/CanACC_Sketches.jpg">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/CanACC_Sketch_2.jpg">

        <br>
        <p>One of my favourite ones I made was the one with the maple leaf breaking off into music notes - I thought it was really fitting because it shows that we can unite as Canadians through music, and we can build community through music, which was the main goal of our concert. Also, the large number of small music notes represent us as singers, since a cappella is all about individual voices joining together to be bigger than the sum of its parts. The downside of that logo was scaling: for small scale usage, the tiny details of the notes would be difficult to print and see. The logo was primarly being used on small promotional items and branding at the top of some documents, so unfortunately it would be unfeasible to continue with that concept.
          <br>
          <br>After bringing concepts to the CanACC organizing committee for feedback, the one that they liked the most was the top left one, with a centered maple leaf and audio waves going out on each side. I also liked this one because the way the audio lines crescendo toward the center places a central focus on the Canada leaf and the logo text, signifing how exciting and loud this event will be. Using Sketch, I created a couple variations. I played around with how the audio waves looked, and if I could maybe fit in the maple leaf directly into the audiowaves.</p>
      
        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/CanACC_Alternatives.png">
      
        <p>These alternatives were again put forth for feedback. The first and fourth ones seemed to have the most amount of popularity, but people wanted to see the intensity of the soundwaves reduced in the first one to reduce clutter, maintain simplicity, and make sure it was feasible at a smaller size. After reducing the soundwave intensity, four alternatives from myself and another organizing member were put up for voting. The following logo won the most votes! </p>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/CanACC_Logo.png"><br>
        <p>The logo was printed on various items, like promotional posters for the showcase concert, buttons for all conference attendees, and on nametags for volunteers and workshop leaders.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/CanACC_Buttons.jpg"><br>
      <h4>Retrospective</h4>
        <p>As usual, I didn't have a lot of time to put together the logo as we were under a time crunch to get materials printed with the logo. If I could go back, I definitely would've wanted to explore some of my initial sketches in a higher-fidelity format using Sketch, particularly the one with the maple leaf breaking into musical notes, and variations on that as well - for example, having the musical notes fall in from the top to create a sense of "falling into place" as opposed to "breaking away," and seeing if I could reduce detail to increase small-scale reproducability. For the actual logo that we chose, I also wish I could've picked a better font that was less generic. I also would've explored more how to make the logo more contained and united, as the elements in the logo feel somewhat spread out and not connected well with each other - the round, smooth waves clash somewhat with the pointiness of the maple leaf. I think the overall logo is not the most inspiring piece, but it truly gave our conference something visually to rally around and an elevated sense of professionalism.</p><br>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>The event was a really great success and everyone had a lot of fun meeting, learning, and enjoying beautiful music from each other. I also championed getting feedback from our conference participants, and got really great feedback on what we did well for the first ever conference and what we could do even better for next year - actually, Macappella from McMaster University, one of the participanting groups, was so inspired that they wanted to take on hosting the conference next year! It's really cool to see such a network and community building already. Can't wait!</p><br>
