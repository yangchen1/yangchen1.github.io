                                The main requirement for the PlayStation store
                                is that it must have the basic functions of an
                                e-commerce website: the ability to browse,
                                search, and purchase products. The store must
                                also be responsive, or be able to render itself
                                for proper viewing and interaction on mobile
                                devices, which have significantly smaller
                                screen space than a desktop computer.<br>
                                <br>
                                As part of a design overhaul project, the
                                design team decided to ask various employees at
                                the SNEI Waterloo location on what they thought
                                the overall user experience of the PlayStation
                                store should be using keywords that the design
                                team came up with while thinking about design
                                heuristics as well as the overall PlayStation
                                brand. Some key words were also added in by the
                                employees during the exercise. In the exercise,
                                the employees were asked to sort the words into
                                three tiers of importance, with the 1st tier
                                being the most important. In the following
                                table, the user experience keywords are shown
                                in order of their overall score.
                            </p><img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src=
                            "img/UXTable.png"><br>
                            <p id="description">
                                <br>
                                The overall score was calculated by giving
                                three points every time it was sorted into 1st
                                tier, two points every time it was sorted into
                                2nd tier, and one point every time it was
                                sorted into 3rd tier, then dividing up that
                                total by the number of employees that
                                participated (nine, in this case.) In other
                                words, if a key word was sorted into 1st tier
                                by all of the participants, its overall score
                                would be 3.<br>
                                <br>
                                As seen, some obvious user experience key words
                                are at the top. An e-commerce store most
                                certainly should be easy to use and organized,
                                and should perform fast to allow for the user
                                to get the product they want as quickly as
                                possible. Other, less technical terms also came
                                up, which the design team felt was important to
                                keep in mind, since users also want to feel
                                certain ways about the overall store based on
                                its aesthetics and user experience choices,
                                such as being seamless and engaging. These also
                                fit in with the PlayStation brand, as many
                                modern video games are becoming more and more
                                engaging, realistic, and seamless. Other design
                                requirements are that the mobile website should
                                include familiar mobile gesture like scrolling
                                down, offer menus for specific navigations,
                                offer an option use the full site, as well as
                                keeping high-level, important functions visible
                                at the top.<br>
                                <br>
                                To remind ourselves of the keywords that we
                                came up with throughout the design process,
                                Wynn created a lovely wordle with the most
                                important keywords having the most prominence.

                                Towards the end of my four months at the
                                Manulife Research, Exploration, and Development
                                (RED) Lab, our team helped run the <a href=
                                "http://www.bus-edpartnership.org/ZOOM-Career-Days.htm">
                                ZOOM Day Challenge</a> - a program designed for
                                local high school students to experience
                                first-hand real-life work. We guided three high
                                school students through a rapid prototyping
                                challenge of making an app that would improve
                                the banking experience. At the beginning, I
                                wasn’t sure where they take our challenge, but
                                in the end I was impressed. After going through
                                a brainstorming exercise, many design
                                iterations and customer interviews, they
                                presented an interactive prototype to encourage
                                saving. They had fun and came out in the end a
                                little more knowledge about iterative mobile
                                app design.<br>
                                <br>
                                Upon reflection, their experience over the
                                course of a day was almost like what I went
                                through the four months of my co-op. Not
                                knowing a lot at the beginning, but eager to
                                learn, and coming out with a lot more knowledge
                                and experience.<br>

                                Overall, my time at the RED Lab was amazing. I
                                got to be in an environment of fun,
                                knowledgable, generally awesome techie people
                                who could really appreciate a good
                                start-up-related joke. (“That’s disruptive!”) I
                                worked on projects focused mostly on user
                                interaction innovation on web and iOS
                                platforms. And even though before this work
                                term I’ve never even owned a Mac before, it was
                                a really cool opportunity to be able to learn
                                Swift and Objective-C. Because of it, I was
                                able to used those skills learned and actually

                                hackathon! Our team also won the co-op
                                innovation challenge for our facial-recognition
                                idea for Manulife security, which was a fun
                                side project.<br>
                                <br>
                                I’ve learned a lot of technical skills this
                                term, but perhaps the most important thing I
                                will be taking away is the spirit of innovation
                                and prototyping. It’s the combination of
                                collaborative and individual work that drives
                                this spirit, and I look forward to implementing
                                this where needed wherever I go in the
                                future.<br>

                                which was a re-invented online banking UI with

                                and look of full control over their bank

                                Side Project.<br>
                                <br>
                                Through a referral, I was asked by the founder
                                of FarmTable to do a quick visual mockup of how
                                the landing page could possibly look. I ended
                                up having time to create a simple layout with
                                the general components.<br>
                                <br>
                                I first started out by asking about the market
                                research the founder had already done in
                                Alberta, and what the farmers and restaurant's
                                needs and frustrations were. In summary, the
                                website needed to look professional, polished,
                                and give them the information they want. Also,
                                the average farmer would not have high
                                technological familiarity, so I wanted to make
                                sure that it was clear what the main function
                                of FarmTable was from the get-go. This led to
                                the idea of visually showing that FarmTable was
                                the bridge between farmers and restaurants,
                                which was included early on in the design
                                process.<br>
                                <br>
                                After some wireframes were drawn out, a quick
                                draft was made in Sketch. In the design, I
                                tried to follow Norman/Nielsen design
                                principles to help the user match the website
                                to their mental model of an e-commerce site. I
                                included example items that the user could
                                order right now order items so that it's clear
                                it's an e-commerce website. This also serves as
                                another entry point for onboarding, as users
                                who would click the clear call-to-action of
                                "Add to Cart" would be taken to a modal or new
                                page to sign-in or register. Further down the
                                page, I created an area to easily sign-up, with
                                visual icons for different types of farms
                                (something I learned about the farming users
                                from interviewing the founder). Overall, I
                                tried to make the design more visual, have
                                minimal text, and straight-forward sign-up to
                                communicate the purpose of FarmTable.<br>
                                <br>
                                If I could go back to improve this project, I
                                would try to map out some of the user flows
                                more and create specificationss for exactly
                                what each interaction item would lead to - this
                                would also lead to the need of creating higher
                                fidelity prototypes, since new interactions are
                                probably needed (e.g. selecting the number of
                                carrots on the example carrot item). I would
                                also like to have designed more screens, such
                                as how the sign-up would have looked like for
                                the restaurant managers. I would also fix the
                                visual unpleasantries - for example, the colour
                                of "farmers" and the background image behind it
                                were simply placeholders, as most of the images
                                and text in the mock-up were.<br>

                                Judio is a social Music-Making App. Users can
                                record their instrument or singing, then send
                                it to their friends. They can then record and
                                layer their own singing/instrument on top of
                                it, and send it out again, etc. to create
                                multi-track music. This makes long-distance
                                music-making possible.<br>
                                <br>
                                I conceived the idea as a result of a personal
                                frustration - a high school friend and I loved
                                to sing together, but we ended up going to
                                different universities. We tried to create
                                multi-track recordings together through various
                                methods: by sending files back and forth
                                through Audacity, by singing through Skype,
                                etc. Nothing worked well for us. Thus, the idea
                                for Judio was born.<br>
                                <br>
                                The first iteration was developed as Android
                                app at MHacks Hackathon January 2013. I worked
                                on it as a developer, focusing on Android

                                about entreprenuership. Each week, we were
                                given talks by the start-up experienced to help

                                Canada's biggest. As part of a team of three, I
                                coded the UI in iOS using Swift, and coded the

                                As Musical Director for ACE, University of
                                Waterloo's largest a cappella group, I created
                                an 8-part arrangement of Sing by My Chemical
                                Romance. I wanted to create story with the
                                arrangement, and started out with a creepy vibe
                                that becomes more hopeful. I also sampled a
                                section of Sing by The Carpenters, a song
                                popularized by Sesame Street.
